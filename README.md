# TaskWave-Project
A WhatsApp integrated Project Management Tool

Introduction & Background
In fast-paced businesses, effective communication is crucial in project management. Current project management systems often rely on fragmented communication channels and manual data entry, resulting in delayed updates, miscommunication, and reduced productivity among project stakeholders. The absence of an integrated tool further complicates coordination between members leading to further setbacks. The Project Management System with WhatsApp API Integration addresses these challenges by combining traditional project management tools with WhatsApp’s real-time messaging. This integration ensures team members receive instant notifications for task assignments, completions, and updates, allowing the project manager to monitor overall workflow and improve productivity while offering abstraction and privacy, ensuring that each team member only has access to the information and tasks pertinent to their responsibilities and deadlines.
Primarily aimed at construction management, this system is tailored to task-driven projects requiring clear task delegation and time-sensitive coordination between team members and managers. By leveraging familiar technology, this approach optimizes collaboration, reduces delays, and enhances project outcomes. 

The objectives of the project are:
1. Enhance Project Management Efficiency – Develop a centralized platform that allows project managers and team members to manage tasks, deadlines, and milestones effectively within specified time.
2. Automate Task Assignments and Reminders – Implement an automated WhatsApp notification system to inform users about task assignments and deadlines, reducing manual follow-ups 
3. Improve Team Collaboration – Provide a real-time collaboration feature, including document sharing and commenting, ensuring seamless communication among team members.
4. Provide Advanced Reporting & Analytics – Enable project progress tracking and team performance measurement with visual dashboards and reports.
5. Ensure Secure User Access and Role Management – Implement a robust access control system, allowing role-based permissions with OAuth2 or JWT authentication.
6. Develop a Mobile-Responsive UI – Ensure the system is fully functional on both mobile and desktop devices using React, Vue.js, or AdminLTE.
